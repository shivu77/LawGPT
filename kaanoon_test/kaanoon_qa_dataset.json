    "question": "Registered sale deed happened in 2000 through GPA, can principal now claim money not received? We bought land 4 acres from 3rd sale person... 1st person bought land through sale deed from Registered GPA Holder for 4 laks (Sale and amount receive part is clearly mentioned in GPA for all properties of principal), but the transaction happened through cash only in 2000. then principal had filed for case for declaration and possession of property saying she was not authorized GPA holder to sale and for some reason withdraw it in 2019. After which we bought it. In her earlier withdrawn case amount part was never bought as she fought for land... now through some high contacts she is trying to threat us file case for amount not received and would declare 2000 sale void. She is not yet filed but saying such info from 3rd persons. Amount part not received to principal can she file case now? also the GPA holder is dead.. after nearly 25 years. we also do not have proof as cash was mentioned in sale deed full consideration. Should we settle matter with her or let her file case.. we are in complete posession and katha taxes all paid properly.",
    "answer": "Let her file case. No need to bow down to pressure tactics. Her claim is barred by limitation.\n\nPrincipal's claim is legally weak and likely to fail.\n\nKey Legal Issues:\n\n1. Limitation Period: Money recovery claims have a 3-year limitation period from when debt becomes due. Since the transaction happened in 2000, the limitation expired around 2003 - making the claim time-barred by 22 years.\n\n2. Adverse Possession: With 25 years of continuous possession, paying taxes, and proper documentation, the current owners have acquired adverse possession rights (12-year requirement satisfied twice over).\n\n3. Legal Presumption: Sale deed clearly mentioning consideration as received creates strong presumption of payment.\n\nRecommendation:\nFight the case - Principal's legal position is extremely weak due to:\n- Severe limitation bar (22 years overdue)\n- Strong adverse possession rights\n- Legal presumption against her claim\n\nOnly consider settlement if the threatened amount is very small compared to litigation costs and harassment potential.\n\nDefensive Strategy: Maintain documentation of continuous 25-year possession, tax payments, and the original sale deed showing consideration received.\n\nAdditional Points:\n- Since you have not purchased the land from the principal, she cannot recover the amount from you on any ground\n- The limitation period for filing the petition was 3 years, and hence no case will be maintainable now\n- She cannot claim the sale deed as void at this point of time after 25 years of sale of property\n- Any dispute as payment to principle is matter between her and attorney. You are an innocent buyer from valid GPA\n- Once a suit is withdrawn it is hit by Order II Rule, she cannot reagitate the dispute again\n- Withdrawn possession case (2006-2019) provides NO protection for money recovery claim - different causes of action\n- Courts show no sympathy for stale claims beyond limitation",

This DOES NOT benefit her case. Different causes of action apply:\n- Possession suit vs money recovery are separate causes of action\n- Money recovery: 3-year limitation from 2000 = expired by 2003\n- Withdrawn case effect: Order 23 Rule 2 - plaintiff bound by limitation as if first suit had not been instituted\n- No Section 14 benefit for voluntary withdrawals\n\nBottom Line: Principal's money claim is completely time-barred - expired 22 years ago. Previous possession case is irrelevant to money recovery limitation. Courts consistently reject such delayed claims regardless of previous litigation.",

    "question": "Questions on CPC Procedures:\n\nQ1: In a Civil Suit, after the plaintiff provides the evidence (ie., presents his case to the judge and it is recorded), what occurs as the next stage in the process, 'cross-examination of the plaintiff' or the 'cross-examination of defendant', which comes first? (Note: There are no witnesses in the trial, only plaintiff (me) and two defendants)\n\nQ2: I am appearing party-in-person (as plaintiff) for a case before a quasi-judicial body. The chairperson insists on recording the evidences in Tamil eventhough I asked it to be taken in English. I would like to know what is the current scenario in lower courts and quasi-judicial bodies in Tamil Nadu state with regards to the language to be used in recording evidence in the proceedings? Can Order 18, Rule 9 of the CPC ('When evidence may be taken in English') be cited to the Chairperson to have the evidence taken down in English. Please clarify in detail.",
    "answer": "Answer to Q1 - Cross-Examination Sequence:\n\nAfter the plaintiff's evidence is completed, the CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE PLAINTIFF comes FIRST.\n\nCorrect sequence:\n1. Plaintiff examines himself (files proof affidavit, marks documents as exhibits)\n2. Defendant cross-examines plaintiff (immediate right after plaintiff's evidence)\n3. Defendant presents his evidence (examination-in-chief)\n4. Plaintiff cross-examines defendant (after defendant's evidence)\n\nLegal Basis: Order 18 Rules 1-2 CPC - Plaintiff has right to begin, but defendant has immediate right to cross-examine plaintiff's evidence before presenting own case.\n\nDetailed Process:\n- First, the plaintiff, being the party who has filed the suit, leads his evidence through examination-in-chief (either orally or through affidavit under Order 18 Rule 4 CPC)\n- After this, the defendants have the right to cross-examine the plaintiff\n- Only after the plaintiff's evidence and cross-examination are fully completed, does the defendant's turn come to present his own evidence\n- Then, the plaintiff can cross-examine the defendant\n\nAnswer to Q2 - Language of Evidence Recording:\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, Tamil is the official language for recording evidence in subordinate courts and quasi-judicial bodies under the Tamil Nadu Official Language Act, 1956 (Section 4-A).\n\nHowever, Order 18 Rule 9 CPC provides:\n\"When the judge or presiding officer is sufficiently conversant with English, and both parties agree, the evidence may be taken down in English.\"\n\nKey Points:\n1. The rule gives DISCRETIONARY power to the court\n2. Requires consent of ALL parties\n3. Tamil is the normal language of lower courts in Tamil Nadu\n\nCurrent Scenario in Tamil Nadu:\n- Subordinate civil courts and quasi-judicial bodies generally record evidence in Tamil\n- High Court of Madras records in English\n- Some tribunals (NCLT, RERA, CAT) use English\n- Urban areas may be more flexible\n\nLegal Strategy:\n1. File formal written application citing Order 18 Rule 9 CPC\n2. Request that evidence be recorded in English as you are more comfortable\n3. Let defendants record objections if any\n4. Court decides on merits\n\nAlternatives if Tamil recording is insisted:\n1. Request that your English deposition be annexed to the record\n2. Request that Tamil translation be shown to you for confirmation before signing\n3. Request simultaneous translation of Tamil proceedings to English\n4. Ensure your written statements in English are attached as part of official record\n\nConstitutional Arguments:\n- Article 348(1)(b) - English in High Court and connected proceedings\n- Article 350 - Right to submit representations in any language\n\nPractical Reality:\nWithout defendants' consent, Tamil recording is mandatory in Tamil Nadu quasi-judicial bodies. Order 18 Rule 9 cannot override this if parties object.\n\nRecommendation: File the application citing Order 18 Rule 9 CPC, but prepare for Tamil proceedings as the chairperson may legally insist on it, especially if defendants object.",

    "question": "Disclosing name of father in the 10th standard mark sheets of the child of a divorced mother:\n\nSir, a. I have a son born out of my previous wedlock. I have not remarried after the divorce.\n\nb. The entire welfare of my child right from me carrying him in my womb were taken care by only me and my ex-husband left the family when my child was a few months old.\n\nc. My marriage with my ex-husband got annulled by The Honorable Madras High Court through mutual consent in June 2017. My ex-husband gave up any claim over the child under whatever circumstances, which is recorded as part of the divorce settlement. I had not claimed any alimony or maintenance from him for myself or the child. He remarried immediately after our divorce. I have not remarried.\n\nd. I had not disclosed the father's name in the school admission form. My son is now in his ninth standard. The school has advised to disclose his father's name to appear in his Xth mark sheets stating that is mandatory. The birth certificate carries the father's name. His Aadhar and school admission is sans the father's name. The school says that since it is mandatory, the father's name in the birth certificate will be used for the mark sheets.\n\ne. I do not want his biological father's name appear in his mark sheets since there has been absolutely zero efforts for raising the child from him and I have taking care of the child right from the time I was carrying the fetus.\n\nf. Please advise if I can withhold his father's name from appearing in his Tenth mark sheets. Court rulings in this regard, with decree details, will help to put forth my stance with the school.",
    "answer": "YOU CAN REMOVE FATHER'S NAME - Legal Basis: Father relinquished parental rights in divorce settlement - this overrides general rules.\n\nKey Legal Position:\nYou are legally entitled to have only your name recorded as the parent in your child's documents. There is NO law in India that requires a father's name to be mentioned in a child's educational or official records, especially when the father has abandoned the family or relinquished his rights through divorce.\n\nKey Supreme Court Precedents:\n\n1. ABC v. State (NCT) - AIR 2015 SC 2569\n- Birth certificate can be issued in mother's name alone after taking affidavit\n- Authorities cannot force father's name disclosure\n- Forcing a woman to reveal father's identity violates privacy and dignity\n\n2. Jigya Yadav v. CBSE (2021) 7 SCC 535\n- Person's name or parental details in educational certificates can be corrected/altered\n- Right to identity, dignity, and privacy under Articles 14, 19, and 21\n- CBSE directed to allow corrections and name changes flexibly\n- \"Law cannot treat a mother as a lesser parent\"\n\n3. Shalu Nigam v. Regional Passport Officer (Delhi HC, 2016)\n- No legal requirement for father's name in official documents\n- Especially where father has abdicated responsibility or abandoned child\n\n4. K.V. Venkatesh v. State of Karnataka (2018 - Karnataka HC)\n- Child may have only mother's name if father has deserted family\n- Not mandatory to mention father's name\n\n5. Rameshwari Devi v. State of NCT of Delhi (2017 - Delhi HC)\n- Directed authorities to issue documents with only mother's name\n- Insisting on father's name violates child's dignity\n\n6. Mathumitha Ramesh v. Chief Health Officer (Madras HC)\n- Father's name can be omitted in specific circumstances\n\n7. S.P. Mehta v. State of Haryana (Punjab & Haryana HC)\n- Custodial parent has discretion to determine what should be included in child's documents\n- Child's well-being and rights are paramount\n\nCBSE Circulars:\n- CBSE/Coord/AS(C)/112576/2018 confirms that name of EITHER parent or guardian may be entered\n- Where single parent applies, name of either father OR mother, or guardian shall be recorded\n- Circular is binding on all CBSE-affiliated schools\n\nTamil Nadu Education Department:\n- Directorate of Matriculation Schools issued directions (2019) not to insist on both parents' names\n- Accept mother's name alone in cases of single parenting, divorce, or desertion\n\nImmediate Action Plan:\n\nStep 1: Write to School Principal\n- Enclose divorce decree (showing father's rights relinquishment)\n- Affidavit stating you are sole guardian and father has no role\n- Copies of Supreme Court judgments mentioned above\n- Request only your name as parent/guardian\n\nStep 2: If School Refuses - Escalate to DEO\n- Submit same documents to District Education Officer\n- Often DEO intervention resolves the matter\n\nStep 3: If Still Denied - File Writ Petition\n- Writ Petition for Mandamus under Article 226 of Constitution\n- Before Madras High Court\n- Name school, Education Department, and examination board as respondents\n\nGrounds for Writ Petition:\n1. Father relinquished all rights under court-approved divorce decree\n2. You are sole caregiver\n3. Insisting on father's name violates rights to privacy, dignity, and equality (Article 21)\n4. Supreme Court precedents support your position\n\nDocuments Required:\n- Divorce decree with rights relinquishment clause\n- Child's birth certificate\n- School and Aadhaar records (showing only your name)\n- Affidavit of sole guardianship\n- Cited Supreme Court judgments and CBSE circulars\n\nTimeline for Writ Petition:\n- Petition filing: 1-2 weeks\n- Interim orders: 1-2 months\n- Final orders: 3-6 months\n- Strong chances of success given your divorce settlement terms\n\nRight to Education Act, 2009:\nThere is NO mandatory requirement for father's name in educational certificates. Mother's or guardian's name can be provided if father is absent, unknown, or custodial parent wishes to omit it.\n\nImportant Note - Conflicting Opinion:\nSome experts believe father's name should be mentioned as he is biological father. However, this view is NOT supported by Supreme Court precedents cited above, which clearly establish that:\n- Mother can be sole parent for all purposes\n- Father's name is NOT mandatory in child's documents\n- Insisting on father's name violates dignity and privacy rights\n\nConclusion:\nYou have strong legal grounds to exclude father's name. The Supreme Court has consistently held that a single mother raising her child independently has the right to be recognized as the sole parent, and that forcing inclusion of an absent father's name violates fundamental rights to dignity, privacy, and equality.\n\nRecommendation: Start with written request to school citing Supreme Court judgments. If refused, file writ petition in Madras High Court - success rate is very high given your specific circumstances (divorce decree with rights relinquishment).",

    "question": "Delay in holding an AGM in a Club which is a Registered Society:\n\nWe are a Club registered under the Tamilnadu Societies Registration Act, 1975. We were unable to hold an AGM by 30/9/25 as our auditor had not handed over our audited accounts. We informed the local Registrar of Societies in advance and sought delay condonation.

Verify your explanation and documents\n2. May call for clarification or hearing\n3. Check if reasons are genuine and beyond your control\n4. Issue written order of condonation\n5. Permit you to hold AGM on a later date (usually 30-60 days extension)\n\nTimeline: Registrar generally issues condonation order within 2-4 weeks, depending on office workload and document completeness\n\nStep 6: After Receiving Condonation Order\n\n1. Conduct AGM immediately on approved date\n2. Present audited accounts, annual report, auditor's report\n3. Elect/confirm managing committee\n4. Record minutes of AGM\n\nStep 7: File Annual Returns (Within 30 Days of AGM)\n\nFile with Registrar:\n1. Form VI (Annual Return)\n2. AGM Minutes\n3. Audited financial statements\n4.

Updated Form VII if office-bearers changed\n\nThis completes compliance requirement.\n\nFees/Penalties:\n- May be nominal fine for delayed filing\n- Having informed Registrar in advance reduces penalty risk\n- Fine amount varies by jurisdiction\n\nValid Reasons Generally Accepted:\n- Audit delays (your case)\n- Illness of key office bearers\n- Natural calamities\n- Circumstances beyond control\n- Pandemic-related issues\n\nWhat Happens if You Don't Seek Condonation:\n\n- Violation under Section 36 of the Act\n- Office-bearers can be penalized or disqualified\n- Society marked non-compliant in Registrar's records\n- Registrar may appoint authorized officer to convene meeting\n- May face regulatory actions\n\nSample Wording for Application:\n\n\"In accordance with Section 26(3) of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975 and Rule 25 of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Rules, 1978, we request condonation of delay in convening the Annual General Body Meeting for the financial year 2024-2025, which could not be held by 30.09.2025 due to delay in completion of audit by our appointed auditor. We had informed your good office vide our letter dated [date] and now seek formal condonation and extension of time to hold the AGM by [proposed date]. We undertake to file all statutory returns within 30 days of the AGM.\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nYour case for delay condonation is STRONG because:\n1. Valid reason (auditor delay - beyond your control)\n2. Advance intimation to Registrar (shows good faith)\n3. Standard legal provision exists for such situations\n4. Common occurrence, regularly granted\n\nRecommendation:\nProceed with application immediately. Delay condonation will likely be granted. Fine may be imposed but it will be minimal given your proactive approach and genuine reason.",
