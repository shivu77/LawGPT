      "question": "Do IT professionals earning 10 LPA need to pay GST?",
      "answer": "If you are a salaried IT professional earning ₹10 LPA, you do NOT need to pay GST. GST applies only to business income, not salary income. However, if you have freelance/consulting income on the side, different rules apply.",
      "detailed_explanation": [
        "**For Salaried IT Employees:**",
        "- Salary income is NOT subject to GST",
        "- You pay only Income Tax (TDS deducted by employer)",
        "- No GST registration required regardless of salary amount",
        "",
        "**For IT Freelancers/Consultants:**",
        "- GST registration threshold: ₹20 lakhs annual turnover (₹10 lakhs for special category states)",
        "- If annual turnover is below ₹20 lakhs: GST registration optional",
        "- If annual turnover exceeds ₹20 lakhs: GST registration mandatory",
        "",
        "**Important:** Annual turnover means total business revenue, not salary. For freelancers earning ₹10 LPA from consulting, they are below the threshold and registration is optional."

      "question": "Income Tax vs GST - what's the difference?",
      "answer": "Income Tax is on your income (salary, profits). GST is on supply of goods/services. A salaried person pays Income Tax but not GST. A freelancer pays both Income Tax (on profit) and GST (on services provided to clients).",

    {
      "question": "Should I register for GST voluntarily if earning below ₹20 lakhs?",
      "answer": "Consider voluntary registration if: (1) Your clients are GST-registered businesses who want input tax credit, (2) You want to appear more professional, (3) You plan to grow beyond threshold soon. Otherwise, registration is optional and adds compliance burden.",
      "pros": [
        "Clients get Input Tax Credit (ITC) on your invoices",

        "Monthly/quarterly GST returns filing required",
        "Additional compliance and paperwork",
        "Penalties for late filing",

        "Annual audit if turnover > ₹5 crores"
      ]

    {
      "question": "How much GST would I pay on ₹10 LPA freelance income?",
      "answer": "If you're a freelancer earning ₹10 LPA and register for GST, you would collect 18% GST from clients (₹1.8 lakhs) and deposit it to government after claiming input tax credit on your expenses.",
