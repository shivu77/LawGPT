💎 Enhanced Prompt: 

Goal:
Create a modern, minimal, data-driven website UI  — a clean, futuristic, premium interface that feels professional and structured.
The design must be generic (usable for AI dashboards, SaaS products, portfolios, or analytics tools) while maintaining the same visual rhythm and component proportions.

🎨 Core Visual System

Base Style

Background: #ffffff (pure white)

Text: #0d1b26 (primary), #6b7278 (secondary)

Borders: 2px solid #0f1720

Cards: 12px rounded corners, subtle shadow 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)

Layout: clean, grid-aligned, 24px gaps, 1320px max width

Aesthetic: flat design with soft depth — futuristic yet calm

No gradients, neon, or clutter; focus on clarity and precision

✍️ Typography

Headings: Poppins or Inter, bold, tight line height (1.1), responsive sizes (48px desktop → 32px mobile)

Body: Inter or Open Sans, 16px, regular weight, high readability

Numbers / Metrics: Roboto Mono or Space Mono, bold, monospaced for consistency

Labels: Uppercase, 13px, letter-spacing 0.1em, slightly dimmed tone

Maintain perfect vertical rhythm — headings, text, and metrics aligned by baseline.

🧩 Layout Architecture

1. Header

Left: minimalist text/logo

Right: clean inline navigation (no buttons)

Top border thin or none — airy and simple

2. Hero Section

Center-aligned headline (bold, 48px)

Subtext below (max-width 720px, muted gray)

3×2 grid of cards (icon + title + one-line description)

3. Stats Strip

Horizontal row (3–4 compact cards)

Each card: large metric (e.g., “91.07%”) + small label (e.g., “24H CHANGE”)

Slight shadow and hover lift

4. Main Content / Dashboard

Left (60%) — highlight cards or bar visuals (icon + value + subtle trend)

Right (40%) — leaderboard or ranked list (name + score + small metric)

5. Tabbed Panel (below)

Tabs: “OVERVIEW | ACTIVE | HISTORY | SETTINGS”

Active tab: black background, white text

Inactive: transparent with hover underline

Tab content: simple table or stat grid

6. Footer

Minimal line or text area (e.g., “Last updated: 5:47 PM”)

Small and unobtrusive

🌈 Color System
Element	Color	Purpose
Primary Text	#0d1b26	Headings, key data
Secondary Text	#6b7278	Descriptions
Accent (Positive)	#2cb67d	Growth / success
Accent (Negative)	#e25555	Decline / warning
Borders	#0f1720	Card outlines
Background	#ffffff	Clean foundation

Use soft accent tones, never harsh saturation.

⚡ Interactions & Motion

Card Hover: transform: translateY(-2px); box-shadow: 0 6px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)

Tabs: smooth underline or fade transition; active tab dark with light text

Metrics: optional fade-in count animation

Responsiveness: stack columns under 960px; maintain spacing hierarchy

🧱 Output Requirements

Stack: React + Tailwind CSS (preferred) or pure HTML/CSS

Fully responsive grid and text scaling

Semantic and accessible markup (no dummy div spamming)

Replace trading content with generic placeholders (e.g., “Project Alpha”, “Performance Index”)

Focus on typography balance, spacing precision, and visual calmness

🧠 Tone & Feel

The interface should feel premium, analytical, quiet, and intelligent — like a modern command center for data.
It should convey discipline, precision, and clarity, never chaos or overdesign.
